# A finite number of keystrokes

I recently watched Scott Hanselman’s talk called [Scaling
Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS1mnISoG7U). He made an
interesting point about how you have a finite number of keystrokes in your life
and you should try to save them when possible. Instead of writing a 5 paragraph
email, turn it into a blog post. Those keystrokes will go farther when they are
not scoped to a single person. This resonated with me because I just sent a long
email to a friend to tell her what I know about transitioning to a career as a
software developer (or a related field).

I love this idea and I’ll try to keep it in mind as time goes on.
