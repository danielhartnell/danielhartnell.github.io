# Welcome

Iâ€™ve tried to keep a number of blogs updated over the years but I usually lose
interest quickly. This blog will have a slightly different scope. Rather than
forcing myself to sit down with the intention of sharing an informative post
with some greater community, I will simply store my notes here. Each post will
be a way for me to document, store and share my notes as I work through problems
or read through books.

```ruby
def welcome
  puts "Thank you for reading"
end
