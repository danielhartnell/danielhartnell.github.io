# Kubernetes

I had a chance to speak with a colleague at work about Kuberntes and I came out
of that conversation with a plan to immerse myself in the Kubernetes world and
grow my knowledge around the subject.

- Understand BGP
- Strong netowrking or OS fundamentals are not required
- I do not need to seek out container-specific networking to understanding
  networking within Kubernetes and Docker
- Interact with the Kubernetes community (or lurk)
- Reading source code will give me a much deeper understanding
- Kubernetes has design patterns like cron and sidecar
- First class patterns in Kubernetes

Action items:

- Continue learning Go
- Join Kubernetes Slack and join channels I'm interested in
- Research and understand BGP
- Review PRs for Kubernetes and associated discussions
- Seek out Kuberntes working groups
- Read through the Kubernetes source code
- Blog about the Kubernetes source as I work through it
- Read through the Kubernetes documentation for an operational understanding
- Spin up a Kubernetes cluster
  - Move a small website to this cluster
  - Keep notes about any issues that I run into at this level
  - Write down stupid questions and ask for help
